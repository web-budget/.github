## webBudget: Simple, Open-Source Financial Management

webBudget is a free and open-source application designed to help individuals and small businesses manage their finances. It offers essential financial management tools with a simple, intuitive interface that provides maximum visibility into your financial activities.

### Project Overview
The project began in 2008 as a desktop application built with Java Swing. It later evolved into a web-based application using JSF, with version 3 remaining the last stable release—still available here.

With version 4, the project is undergoing a complete overhaul to modernize its architecture and introduce more powerful features. As part of this transformation, we've created a new GitHub organization to separate the backend from the frontend and to improve the management of project features and development.

### Technology Stack
While previous versions of webBudget relied on JSF and PrimeFaces — which served us well for many years — we decided it was time to embrace a more modern and scalable technology stack. The new version is being rebuilt using:

- Kotlin 2
- Spring Boot 3
- VueJS 3
- PostgreSQL 16

This update allows us to deliver a better developer and user experience, while maintaining the simplicity and clarity that have always been at the heart of webBudget.
