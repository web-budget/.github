## welcome to webBudget

webBudget is a free and open-source application to manage your personal finances or even for small companies. It will provide basic financial management with simple and clear functionalities 
and giving maximum visibility on what is happening. 

### The project

The project started as a desktop application writen in swing back in 2008, it evolved to a JSF version (until v3) (that are still available)[https://github.com/arthurgregorio/web-budget] and 
is the last stable version. Now with the v4, the goal is to give a complete overhaul in the project to make it more modern also add more relevant features to it.

To start that, we created a new organization to split the backend from frontend and also provide a better management for the project fetures.

### The tecnologies

Since the first web version from webBudget we are using the good old JSF with Primefaces, we could continue on that since the software doesn't required a fancy UI but given the scenario where we
could do better, the tecnologies changed a bit from the older version:

- Kotlin 1.9
- Spring Boot 3
- Nuxt 3
- Postgres 15
